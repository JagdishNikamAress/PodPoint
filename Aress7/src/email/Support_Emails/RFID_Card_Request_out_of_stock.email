Hi {!Case.Contact},

We are currently out of stock of the RFID card's! Once we have some back in I will pop one out in post for you!
 
In the meantime to access our older style of POD's you can use either a contact less debit or credit card or an oyster card! They have the same RFID technology in them.
 
If you use a contact less card it will NOT charge you. Our older POD's are free to use so there is no worry of having to pay for them.
