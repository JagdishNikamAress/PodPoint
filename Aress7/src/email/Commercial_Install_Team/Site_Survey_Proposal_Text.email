Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

I would like to propose the following date to schedule in a site survey at {!Account.Name} - {!Case.City__c} to allow us to provide a quote for the installation of the electric vehicle charge points requested.

Our first available slot is {!Case.Survey_Scheduled_Start_Date_Time__c} which has been scheduled. Please let us know if this is not a good time for you.

Could you confirm that the site contact on the day will be yourself on {!BLANKVALUE(Contact.Phone, Contact.MobilePhone)} and review the following address:

{!Account.Name} 
{!Case.Street__c}
{!Case.City__c}
{!Case.PostalCode__c}


Your engineer will be {!WorkOrder.Technician__c} who will arrive as close as possible to the agreed time slot, but please allow for up to an hour of fluctuation around the arrival time.

We will need access to the relevant distribution board and plant room, any area affected by the installation of the charge-point supply cable and the desired charge-point location. The survey should be complete within 1 hour.


Please donâ€™t hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.


Kind regards,
