{!Case.Scheduled_On__c}

Your engineer will be {!Case.Installer__c} who will arrive as close as possible to the agreed time slot but please allow for up to an hour of fluctuation around the arrival time.

Equipment for the installation will be shipped to the below address shortly before the installation date:

To successfully carry out the installation we will need:

- Permission to turn off the distribution board to be used for the supply of the new charge-points for approximately 30 minutes.
- The relevant parking bays at the location of the new charge-points to be free of vehicles.
- All permissions for works to be in place.
- Barriers in place for area of works, if required.
- Adequate spare supply capacity available at the distribution board to be used for the charge-points.
- To be notified if RAMS are required prior to installation.
- To be updated if the shipping address differs from the above.

Please don’t hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.


Kind Regards,
