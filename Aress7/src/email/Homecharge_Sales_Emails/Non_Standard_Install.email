Hi {!Account.FirstName},

If you could help us out and send over photos of the following for our installation team, it would be greatly appreciated! Our POD Point Experts find these photos very useful before they arrive. We can also provide a non obligation quote in advance of the installer arriving so you know what you will be looking at in total.


• Clear and close up images of all your fuse boards (showing labels and fuses numbers)
• Electricity meter, main fuse and surroundings (inside the DNO box if this applies)
• Proposed cable route for the cables, POD location and confirmation of cable route length
• A photo of your off-street parking
• Please also email us your address
