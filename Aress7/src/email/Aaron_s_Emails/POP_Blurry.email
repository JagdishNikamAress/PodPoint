Hi {!Account.FirstName},

Thanks for sending these in.
 
We just need a quick amendment and we'll be able to move things forward for you
 
The photo of the order form that you've so kindly sent is too small a file, and is a little to blurry to read when zooming in. Sadly the Government (OLEV)wont accept it. 
Would you be so kind as to send either a higher resolution photo OR, a photo taking closure up just showing to the top half of the form please.
