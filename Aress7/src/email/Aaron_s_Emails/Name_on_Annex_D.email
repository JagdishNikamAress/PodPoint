Hi {!Account.FirstName}

Thanks for these photos...All looks well.

The only thing we need to clarify is that your happy for the internal part of the cable run to be above ground and concealed inside white trunking or indeed if you wish for the flooring to be lifted and the cable to run underground?

If so you're happy for the cable to run above ground in trunking we can get you scheduled in right now?
