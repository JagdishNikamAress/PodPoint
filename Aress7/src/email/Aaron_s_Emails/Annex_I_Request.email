Hi {!Account.FirstName},

As this is a Company Car, OLEV require the completion of an 'Annex I / Company Letter form also.
 
Please copy the text from the template word for word, replacing the generic text for your own details, show your company letterhead at the top and sign the bottom adding the position you hold within your company also.
 
Unless the 'Annex I' is completed as above the Office for Low Emissions won't approve it (Template Attached)
