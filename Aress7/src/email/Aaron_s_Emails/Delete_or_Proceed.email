Hi {!Account.FirstName},

Further to previous contact attempts I just wanted to touch base with you regarding an Electric Vehicle Home Charger under the government OLEV grant scheme for your EV.

Would you be so kind as to inform me if this is something you still wish to pursue or if it is no longer required.

If we have not received a response to this email within 7 days we will sadly have to remove your details.

Thank you and have a nice day.
