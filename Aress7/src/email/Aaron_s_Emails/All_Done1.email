Hi {!Account.FirstName}, 

We now have all of your OLEV grant application documents. 

I'd like to take this opportunity to thank you again for your business and secondly.... 

Advise you that I have now moved your application along to the OLEV team to check your documents and they will then pass your case onto the installation team who will be in contact to arrange install date for you.

Have A Nice Day
