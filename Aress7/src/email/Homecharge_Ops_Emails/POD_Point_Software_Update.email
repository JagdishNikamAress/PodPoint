Hi {!Contact.FirstName}

I Hope you are well.

We are rolling out a software update across some of our units to improve reporting, including the unit at {!Opportunity.Account}

This would only take around 20 minute per unit and we do not need access to the distribution board.

Would you like me to go ahead and send an engineer or are there any prerequisites you need before we attend site?
