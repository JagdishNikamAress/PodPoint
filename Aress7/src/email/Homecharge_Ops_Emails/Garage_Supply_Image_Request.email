Hi {!Account.Name},  

You mention the installation will need to take place in a garage, this is usually no problem but there are a few pictures that would make installing on the day a lot easier, 

Would you be able to take a picture of the upstream fuseboard feeding the garage, as well as any electrics you may have in the garage as it stands?

Please do give me a call if this is any easier to describe on the phone,
