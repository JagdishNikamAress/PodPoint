Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

I am very sorry to hear that your installation could not be completed on the day! Our POD Point Expert informed us that your main fuse is not rated high enough to support the additional load of the charge point. Please see our terms here: https://pod-point.com/standard-install-and-olev-terms-conditions

You'll need to have the main fuse upgraded to 80A before we can come back to install. Please contact your electrical distribution network operator (DNO) to have this done. Once you know when this will be completed let us know we will reschedule you a new date.Â

If you have any questions let me know!
