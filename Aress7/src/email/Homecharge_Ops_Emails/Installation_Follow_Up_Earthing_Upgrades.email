Hi {!Account.Name},

I am very sorry to hear that your installation could not be completed on the day! Our POD Point Expert informed us that your installation does not fall within our standard terms and conditions; and therefore, the installation was paused till further notice. Please see our terms here: https://pod-point.com/standard-install-and-olev-terms-conditions

We require you to have earthing bonds installed on your water and gas supplies before we can install. We advise contacting a qualified electrician to complete these works. Once the works are complete, if you can send over an image of the completed works, we will reschedule you a new date. 

Kind regards,
