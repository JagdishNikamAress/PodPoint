Hi {!Account.Name},

I hope you are well. 

For OLEV purposes are you able to send over a land registry to show that your parking space is allocated to your building so we can submit it with your claim after the installation to the DVLA. If you don't have one, you can request a land registry from here: https://www.gov.uk/search-property-information-land-registry

We are looking for the document which looks similar to the attached.

Kind regards,
